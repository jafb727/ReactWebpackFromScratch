# React Webpack from Scratch

## Description

React Webpack from Scratch project has an intention to serve as a starting point to skill React Webpack configuration; merely, concentrates on experimenting and exploring the most common features webpack offers at bundling to master and discover already know and new setup options.

Building a React app can be tricky, especially when defining ESLint rules which makes you setup a project up to date and fully functional without any compile errors, warnings or else.

## Installation

This project is hosted in GitHub. To install it you will need to clone using this URL: https://github.com/jafb727/ReactWebpackFromScratch.git. After that run "npm i" or "yarn" command in a new terminal window.

## Usage

I created this project to be as simple as possible, as the main purpose was not to train React skills but webpack configuration. All project resources are in /src folder which contains a minimized folder structure. To start the app you will need to run "npm run start:dev" command, then, home page should render a basic html markup.
